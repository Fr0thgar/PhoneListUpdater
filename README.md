# PowerShell Script for Updating SharePoint Phone List

## The Script is setup to install all necessary dependencies, but the Prerequisites instructions are here just in case...

## Overview

- Data from the CSV file is synchronized with the SharePoint list.

## How to Run a PowerShell Script
To run a PowerShell script, follow these steps:

### 1. Ensure PowerShell is Installed
Windows comes with PowerShell preinstalled.
To check your version, open PowerShell and run:
powershell
Copy
Edit
``` powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```
### 2. Set Execution Policy (If Needed)
By default, Windows may prevent script execution for security reasons. You may need to change the execution policy:

Open PowerShell as Administrator
Run the following command:
powershell
Copy
Edit
``` powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Press Y and hit Enter to confirm.
### 3. Navigate to the Script Location
Use the cd command to change directories to where the script is stored. Example:

powershell
Copy
Edit
``` powershell
cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Script"
```
### 4. Run the Script
To execute the script, type:

powershell
Copy
Edit
``` powershell
.\YourScript.ps1
```
or

powershell
Copy
Edit
``` powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Your\Script.ps1"
```
### 5. Alternative: Run via Right-Click
Locate the .ps1 script file
Right-click > Select Run with PowerShell
### 6. Automate with Task Scheduler (Optional)
To schedule the script to run automatically:

Open Task Scheduler
Click Create Basic Task
Set a trigger (daily, startup, etc.)
Set an action as:
powershell
Copy
Edit
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\Your\Script.ps1"
Click Finish
